# Customer-Churn
This project anaylizes predicts the likelihood of customer churn based on the data provided.

The Customer Churn dataset, included as an excel file in the provided code directory,  contains 20,000 examples, each with 12 attributes, describing features of customers of a mobile phone provider. Customer churn signifies which customers have stopped using one company's product or service during a certain time frame. The fileâ€™s fields include data on each customer such as their education, income, value of house, their monthly usage situation (like the number of over 15 mins calls, average call duration), and whether they churned within a month when the data was captured. The data was uniformly sampled from the full database. The goal of the data set is to predict the class variable LEAVE representing whether each customer decided to quit the company or not. The class variable, LEAVE, is the last variable on each line, and its legal values are LEAVE and STAY.
